---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

This script uses apt update to refresh the package list and then checks for upgradable packages using apt list --upgradable. If updates are available, it notifies the user to run sudo apt upgrade to install them.

Keep in mind that running system updates requires elevated privileges (sudo). Users may need to enter their password for the updates to be installed.

Please note that this script is specific to Debian-based systems. For other package managers or distributions, you would need to modify the script accordingly. Additionally, this script assumes a basic setup, and in a production environment, you might want to enhance it with error handling and additional features.
